Math\+Jax is an open-\/source Java\+Script display engine for La\+TeX, Math\+ML, and Ascii\+Math notation that works in all modern browsers. It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-\/on-\/the-\/web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems. It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily. Simply include Math\+Jax and some mathematics in a web page, and Math\+Jax does the rest.

Some of the main features of Math\+Jax include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item High-\/quality display of La\+TeX, Math\+ML, and Ascii\+Math notation in HTML pages
\item Supported in most browsers with no plug-\/ins, extra fonts, or special setup for the reader
\item Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers
\item Supports math accessibility, cut-\/and-\/paste interoperability, and other advanced functionality
\item Powerful API for integration with other web applications
\end{DoxyItemize}

See \href{http://www.mathjax.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+mathjax.\+org/}} for additional details about Math\+Jax, and \href{https://docs.mathjax.org}{\texttt{ https\+://docs.\+mathjax.\+org}} for the Math\+Jax documentation.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Math\+Jax Components}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md2}
Math\+Jax version 3 uses files called {\itshape components} that contain the various Math\+Jax modules that you can include in your web pages or access on a server through Node\+JS. Some components combine all the pieces you need to run Math\+Jax with one or more input formats and a particular output format, while other components are pieces that can be loaded on demand when needed, or by a configuration that specifies the pieces you want to combine in a custom way. For usage instructions, see the \href{https://docs.mathjax.org}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax documentation}}.

Components provide a convenient packaging of Math\+Jax\textquotesingle{}s modules, but it is possible for you to form your own custom components, or to use Math\+Jax\textquotesingle{}s modules directly in a node application on a server. There are \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web}{\texttt{ web examples}} showing how to use Math\+Jax in web pages and how to build your own components, and \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node}{\texttt{ node examples}} illustrating how to use components in node applications or call Math\+Jax modules directly.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{What\textquotesingle{}s in this Repository}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md3}
This repository contains only the component files for Math\+Jax, not the source code for Math\+Jax (which are available in a separate \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax source repository}}). These component files are the ones served by the CDNs that offer Math\+Jax to the web. In version 2, the files used on the web were also the source files for Math\+Jax, but in version 3, the source files are no longer on the CDN, as they are not what are run in the browser.

The components are stored in the {\ttfamily es5} directory, and are in ES5 format for the widest possible compatibility. In the future, we may make an {\ttfamily es6} directory containing ES6 versions of the components.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Installation and Use}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md4}
\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Using Math\+Jax components from a CDN on the web}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md5}
If you are loading Math\+Jax from a CDN into a web page, there is no need to install anything. Simply use a {\ttfamily script} tag that loads Math\+Jax from the CDN. E.\+g.,


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<script id="{}MathJax-\/script"{} async src="{}https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-\/mml-\/chtml.js"{}></script>}

\end{DoxyCode}


See the \href{https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html\#browser-components}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax documentation}}, the \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax Web Demos}}, and the \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax Component Repository}} for more information.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Hosting your own copy of the Math\+Jax Components}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md6}
If you want to host Math\+Jax from your own server, you can do so by installing the {\ttfamily mathjax} package using {\ttfamily npm} and moving the {\ttfamily es5} directory to an appropriate location on your server\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm install mathjax@3}
\DoxyCodeLine{mv node\_modules/mathjax/es5 <path-\/to-\/server-\/location>/mathjax}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that we are still making updates to version 2, so include {\ttfamily @3} when you install, since the latest chronological version may not be version 3.

Alternatively, you can get the files via Git\+Hub\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git mj-\/tmp}
\DoxyCodeLine{mv mj-\/tmp/es5 <path-\/to-\/server-\/location>/mathjax}
\DoxyCodeLine{rm -\/rf mj-\/tmp}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then (in either case) you can use a script tag like the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<script id="{}MathJax-\/script"{} async src="{}<url-\/to-\/your-\/site>/mathjax/tex-\/chtml.js"{}></script>}

\end{DoxyCode}


where {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}url-\/to-\/your-\/site\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is replaced by the URL to the location where you moved the Math\+Jax files above.

See the \href{https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html}{\texttt{ documentation}} for details.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Using Math\+Jax components in a node application}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md7}
To use Math\+Jax components in a node application, install the {\ttfamily mathjax} package\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm install mathjax@3}

\end{DoxyCode}


(we are still making updates to version 2, so you should include {\ttfamily @3} since the latest chronological version may not be version 3).

Then require {\ttfamily mathjax} within your application\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{require('mathjax').init(\{ ... \}).then((MathJax) => \{ ... \});}

\end{DoxyCode}


where the first {\ttfamily \{ ... \}} is a Math\+Jax configuration, and the second {\ttfamily \{ ... \}} is the code to run after Math\+Jax has been loaded. E.\+g.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{require('mathjax').init(\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  loader: \{load: ['input/tex', 'output/svg']\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}).then((MathJax) => \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  const svg = MathJax.tex2svg('\(\backslash\)\(\backslash\)frac\{1\}\{x\string^2-\/1\}', \{display: true\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{  console.log(MathJax.startup.adaptor.outerHTML(svg));}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}).catch((err) => console.log(err.message));}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{Note\+:}} this technique is for node-\/based application only, not for browser applications. This method sets up an alternative DOM implementation, which you don\textquotesingle{}t need in the browser, and tells Math\+Jax to use node\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily require()} command to load external modules. This setup will not work properly in the browser, even if you webpack it or bundle it in other ways.

See the \href{https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html\#server-nodejs}{\texttt{ documentation}} and the \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax Node Repository}} for more details.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Reducing the Size of the Components Directory}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md8}
Since the {\ttfamily es5} directory contains {\itshape all} the component files, so if you are only planning one use one configuration, you can reduce the size of the Math\+Jax directory by removing unused components. For example, if you are using the {\ttfamily tex-\/chtml.\+js} component, then you can remove the {\ttfamily tex-\/mml-\/chtml.\+js}, {\ttfamily tex-\/svg.\+js}, {\ttfamily tex-\/mml-\/svg.\+js}, {\ttfamily tex-\/chtml-\/full.\+js}, and {\ttfamily tex-\/svg-\/full.\+js} configurations, which will save considerable space. Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than {\ttfamily tex-\/chtml.\+js}, and the {\ttfamily input/tex/extensions}, {\ttfamily output/chtml/fonts/woff-\/v2}, {\ttfamily adaptors}, {\ttfamily a11y}, and {\ttfamily sre} directories. If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove {\ttfamily adaptors} as well.

If you are not using A11Y support (e.\+g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove {\ttfamily a11y} and {\ttfamily sre} as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the Math\+Jax contextual menu in order to avoid Math\+Jax trying to load them when they aren\textquotesingle{}t there).

If you are using SVG rather than Common\+HTML output (e.\+g., {\ttfamily tex-\/svg.\+js} rather than {\ttfamily tex-\/chtml.\+js}), you can remove the {\ttfamily output/chtml/fonts/woff-\/v2} directory. If you are using Math\+ML input rather than TeX (e.\+g., {\ttfamily mml-\/chtml.\+js} rather than {\ttfamily tex-\/chtml.\+js}), then you can remove {\ttfamily input/tex/extensions} as well.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{The Component Files and Pull Requests}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md9}
The {\ttfamily es5} directory is generated automatically from the contents of the Math\+Jax source repository. You can rebuild the components using the command


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm run make-\/es5 -\/-\/silent}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that since the contents of this repository are generated automatically, you should not submit pull requests that modify the contents of the {\ttfamily es5} directory. If you wish to submit a modification to Math\+Jax, you should make a pull request in the \href{https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src}{\texttt{ Math\+Jax source repository}}.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Math\+Jax Community}\label{md_node_modules_mathjax_README_autotoc_md10}
